 # Animation Options!
 
 There are different kinds of options available to try on your animations. You can, of course, read the documentation by option+click-ing `UIView.AnimationOptions` below. But, if you wonder what they actually *look like*, here are some experiments to try :
 
 1. Click "Animate!" and compare the animation easing options we've fill in for you. 
 2. There is one more easing option: `.curveLinear`, which applies no easing at all. Try replacing `.curveEaseInOut` with `.curveLinear`.
 3. Try adding `.repeat` to each set of options.
 4. Now add `.autoreverse` to each set of options as well. Notice the interplay of autoreverse and the different types of easing options.
